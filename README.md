# arch-yuzu-mainline

This repository stores the Yuzu emulator [mainline branch](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-mainline) release binaries generated from an Arch Linux based Docker image ([DockerFile](https://github.com/linux-gamers/arch-yuzu-mainline/blob/master/Dockerfile)). In the future we aim to provide automated releases (also for AUR ->  at the moment the releases are published by hand).

It is not affiliated with the offical development team, and the [official project's license](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-mainline/blob/master/license.txt) should be respected.
